# Dynamic Robot Defense

This is a clone of [Robot Defense](https://github.com/techannihilation/Robot-Defense) where we work on complete dynamic spawning of robots.

## TODO

- Add Bosses (strong units that spawn at stages).
- Bonus for killing stuff in robot base - robot makes base.

## Changes

### v0.1.3

- 31.Dec.2017: Make multiple bots fully working, means by adding 2 bots you get two times the harder game.

### v0.0.3

- 28.Dec.2017: Add logic so Robots attack big eco spots first.
